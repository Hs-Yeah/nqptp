## Version: 1.1-dev-44-g827e624
* Modidy `install-exec-hook` to use the standard `$DESTDIR` variable instead of the fixed location `/lib/systemd/`. This is to facilitate build environments that install into a separate directory (e.g. cross-compiling environments). Thanks to [HiFiBerry](https://github.com/hifiberry).

## Version: 1.1-dev-40-g6111d69
* Fix a crashing bug. Thanks to [ste94pz](https://github.com/ste94pz) for reporting and debugging.

## Version: 1.1-dev-36-g880b424
